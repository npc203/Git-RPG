## Inspiration
I've been relying on git and github by a LOT lately, familiarizing with commands and it's flags. This always ends me up searching in stackoverflow. So in-order to reinforce my knowledge and to make my life a little simpler, I attempted to make this app.

## What it does
This is a simple command line game, that relies on executing the correct git commands to progress further.It has multiple ways to solve a problem and hence helps to get a hang of the commands and makes version control easier to handle.

## How I built it
Simple basic python and a few stylish ASCII arts. A few helper and pip libraries as well.

## Challenges I ran into
- Cross platform support
- Design of the levels so that the user doesn't soft lock himself into a level

## What we learned
- More python and UI automation.

## What's next for Git RPG
- More levels, More complex strategies, multiple endings.
