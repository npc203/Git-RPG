# Git-RPG
A cmd-line game to learn github

- Yeah This is something I tried during the weekend
- run the main.py and pray that it works without bugging out (well u do need to install some libs like termcolor,sqlite3,tkinter)
- Works on my machine without bugs, Made this for tidy hacks.
- Need more levels and content
